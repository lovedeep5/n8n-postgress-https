# 🚀 n8n Installation Using Docker (n8n + PostgreSQL + Redis + HTTPS)

Easily deploy `n8n` with PostgreSQL, Redis, and HTTPS using Docker and Caddy reverse proxy.

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Ensure your server has the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

---

## 📦 Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lovedeep5/n8n-compose-with-https.git
cd n8n-compose-with-https
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Open and edit the `.env` file:

```bash
nano .env
```

Update the following variables:

```env
DOMAIN=example.com
SUB_DOMAIN=automation
```

> This will create a full domain like: `automation.example.com`

---

### 3. Update Domain in Caddy Reverse Proxy

Open the Caddy file:

```bash
nano Caddyfile
```

Update the Caddy block with your domain:

```caddyfile
automation.example.com {
    reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {
        flush_interval -1
    }
}
```

---

### 4. Start the Services

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

---

### 5. (Optional) View Logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

## 📁 File Structure

```
n8n-compose-with-https/
├── .env
├── docker-compose.yml
├── caddy_data/            # Auto-generated by Caddy for SSL
└── README.md
```

---

## 🌐 Access

Once setup is complete, you can access `n8n` via:

```
https://automation.example.com
```

---

## 🔒 SSL & Security

- SSL certificates are automatically issued by [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com).
- Make sure port **80** and **443** are open in your server firewall.

---

## 🧠 Tip

If your DNS does not support wildcard subdomains, make sure `automation.example.com` is properly pointed to your server IP.
